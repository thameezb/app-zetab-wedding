# app-zetab-wedding

Idea is to create a simple flutter web-app which houses the details of my upcoming wedding.

## General Requirements

- Should have an easy to navigate to URL and QR code.
- Aim is for a simple web-app for now. As flutter has been chosen, shifting this to iOS and Android should be fairly simple.

## Proposed Architecture

- Flutter as chosen language
- Firebase as DB
- Youtube Live for video streaming
- Google Maps for location

## Pages

### Nikkah

This section should house:

- Event location and information (time and date)
  - Location should be both displayed as a Google map and clickable navigation link
- Arabic and English translation of the Ayah generally recited during the Nikkah
- Either an embedded Zoom/Youtube Live stream or point to the location to join virtually

### Reception

This section should:

- House Event location and information (time and date)
  - Location should be both displayed as a Google map and clickable navigation link
- Allow for RSVP of registered guests
- Only be accessible by registered guests

### Media

- This section should allow uploads of media to a specific location. At a later stage these files should be made available to registered guests.

## How to contribute

Please feel free to create a PR to contribute code. Open to design and architectural designs.
Also keen for people with published applications to help guide that process should we choose to go down that road.
Designers are also asked to contribute as that is a genuine weakness at this point.
